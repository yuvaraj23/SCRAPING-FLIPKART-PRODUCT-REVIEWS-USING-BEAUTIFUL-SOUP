3,Just okay,Patna,5 months ago,honest comment...1) Pictures are dull as compared to other big brand led tv.2) Sound is not clear.3) Frequent connectivity loss.4) Difficult to install and run outside apps.But overall...if you are thinking to just have a TV for next 3 years and change to better one...buy this one..for 18k I can't get much. So 3 star is best suited for this TV.

But I am not happy with the "Jeeves" the demo & installation provider of MI because even after 3 days of purchase, they not will respond properly about when they will come for demo and even the allocated person not receiving any call so might you need to wait for unnecessary more full days just to welcoming them.

4,Wonderful,Hyderabad,6 months ago,If you are looking Android in the range. I would say it is the best. I have reduced one star because it has limited set of app, which we can install and on search also it doesn't find them. Netflix, Airtel TV app are the examples which aren't available. When people are moving to digital, it is one drawback. Although chrome cast is solving this problem by mirroring device.

You should ensure good internet speed to see jalwa of this fully android Tv.You should have full HD feed STB then only you can see vibrant colour . you can play 4K videos also(can't confirm about video quality) but FULL HD videos you can feel. Mi should consider to provide HDMI cable and IR cable  , RS 500 should't be a  big deal for company like MI.

4,Nice product,Dakshina Kannada,6 months ago,picture quality 1920x1080 superb 10/10connectivity : pendrive and HDD are easily accessible. Casting fails sometimes as TV is not available in the list of available devices and needs restart.  Voice control takes a few seconds to start recording, the delay is quite long sometimes and irritating.Sound : Sound is very loud. Even with a bit of volume, it is pretty audible in a big room. But the lows are very bad. Unable to hear low voices if the volume is low. Keeping it loud makes the highs...

4,Nice product,Sri Ganganagar,7 months ago,The best android TV. In the present environment of our country, though the price is less but can be more cost-effective if it can be made available in less than 20K. Only one thing is pinching that wall mount is not included which needs to be purchased while installation by an additional cost of Rs 500/- However, I am fully satisfied with this product. Nothing has been compromised in built-in quality in terms of technology or other features.

This is very annoying and it needs to be fixed in the next update.

1,Absolute Garbage!,New Delhi,7 months ago,Picture quality is pathetic, not even near to samsung or sony, Sounds like plastic. Screen resolution is 720p and not full HD. MI is cheating its customers.It says as smart tv but you do not get any native app, not even YouTube which prevents you from playing videos in high resolution. Forget about Netflix and Prime video. Chromecast is just to show screensavers on the sreen, there is no other use of Chromecast.Regretting the decision of buying this crap. Sold it on OLX within a month.

The tv won‚Äôt start when connected to power and flipkart seems not to care about its customers. All the numbers i have receieved of technicians are either unavailable or switched off. They are probably scamming me waiting for the 10 days to end and then i will be stuck with a tv that does not work.

Picture quality mind-blowing for the price.

4,Very Good,Chennai,8 months ago,Worth the money for buying smart Tv for this price range. The HD quality and sound is awesome. 3 USB and 3 HDMI ports are plus for this TV and it's a new release of the year. Only cons i feel is the non availability auto source selection feature(PS:After March update this feature is now available) and for people who used usual remotes this would be new. The mute button isn't available and more of the actions can be done using voice command. On the whole a perfect purchase.

4,Very Good,Dharuhera,8 months ago,Everything is good with this TV. Viewing angle and picture quality are great but I feel sound is extraordinary. It gives high and loud surrounding sound. But the only reason I'm giving it 4 not 5 stars is the lag problem. It usually works slow when you're using YouTube or any other app. It think it's because of its 1gb ram and poor processor. If feels like a mobile with low specifications which has lag problem.Apart from this this TV is great.

After making calls many time, I was informed by the technician that it would take 2 or 3 days more as wall mount stand is not in stock.    Ho gyi aisi tessi excitement ki.                Better to buy it from mi directly.                           Almost 3 out of 4 customers have complained against jeeves. Why don't u take care of it as still there is no improvement in this regard

1,Not recommended at all,Kashipur,8 months ago,Only issue is Installation services from Jeeves (vendor). I am a working person and can not get demo done during working hours hence requested either to visit after 6.30 pm or Sunday. Jeeves got agree for Sunday which is today (03.02.2019) but nobody turned or even called me while i tried calling the given number which was not picked up. Without discussions or my consent, Jeeves rescheduled it for tomorrow (04.02.2019), which is not acceptable to me and did not like it at aƒ∫l.
